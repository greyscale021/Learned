## 1. Core Linux Navigation Commands

These are the fundamental commands you must master to navigate Linux confidently.


###  `pwd` (Print Working Directory)

```bash
pwd # Shows your current location in the filesystem.
```


### `ls` (List)

```bash
ls      # Lists files in the current directory.
ls -l   # Long format (permissions, owner, size, date)
ls -a   # Show hidden files (files starting with `.`)
ls -la  # Show long formatted hidden files
ls -h   # Human-readable file sizes
ls -R   # Recursive (shows subdirectories)
ls -lah # long format, hidden, human readable
```


### `cd` (Change directory)

```bash
cd <foldername> # Change directory to <foldername>
cd ..      # Go up/back one level
cd ~       # Go to home directory
cd /       # Go to root directory
cd -       # Go to previous directory
```

We can define paths as two types:

```bash
cd /home/user/Documents # Absolute Path (full path from root)
cd Documents            # Relative Path (from current directory)
```

### `tree` (if installed)

```bash
tree # Displays directory structure visually.
```


### `find`

```bash
find . -name "file.txt" # Search for files.
# Structure: find [starting-point] [expression]
# Starting-point: . current working directory, / root, ~ home.
```

### `locate`

```bash
locate filename # Fast file search (uses an indexed database).
sudo updatedb # to update the database for 'locate'
```

### `stat` (Status)

```bash
stat filename # Shows detailed file information(size, permissions, ownership, access)
```


### `realpath`

```bash
realpath file.txt # Shows the full absolute path of a file.
```


### `clear`

```bash
clear # Clears the terminal screen. Shortcut- (Ctrl + L)
```
### `pushd` (push directory) | `popd` (pop directory)
```bash
pushd <direcotry> # Moves to <direcotry> and saves previous directory onto a stack
popd # Pops the top directory from the stack and moves you there (LIFO)
dirs # Displays the current directory stack
```

## Command related tools :)

### `whatis`

whatis <command> # Shows what does this command do in one sentence
```

### `type`
```bash
type <command> # Shows what kind of command is this
```

### `which`
```bash
which <command> # Shows the exact executable that will run when you type a command
```

### `whereis`
```bash
whereis <command> # Shows all known locations of a command
```

### `man` (Manual)
```bash
man <command> # opens the official manual for <command>
```

## Special Navigation Symbols
